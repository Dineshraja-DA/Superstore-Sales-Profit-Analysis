# Superstore-Sales-Profit-Analysis
Created Tableau dashboards to track sales, profit, and key metrics across regions and product categories. Analyzed trends in sales growth, order quality, and profit margins, providing actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, enhance business performance, and drive profitability.
